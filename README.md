## Stochastic Optimization for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)

This repository contains the code I developed as part of a **Stochastic Optimization** course project. The goal was to design and implement a solution to the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**, capable of handling relatively large instances, using stochastic and evolutionary-inspired techniques.

All the code and ideas in this project are entirely my own. The course provided general guidance on available tools and methodologies, but the design, implementation, and experimentation were done independently.

### Key Features

- Solves medium to large TSP instances.
- Fully original implementation from scratch.
- Inspired by evolutionary and stochastic methods, with customized design.
- Modular, readable, and well-documented codebase.
